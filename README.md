# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

I used bootStrap for this project.

My first controls are play and stop, they play and stop the song.

Next is my CPM, it sets the cpm, by an integer input.

Next I have a dropdown and button to add a new item to my accordion.

Then I have my accordion, which holds the more controls set for each specific instrument, in the accordion.
It has a title for the instrument and a unique id.

I also have a button for each accordion entry to remove the entry.

I have drag range for volume and reverb, for each instrument in the accordion, these change the volume and reverb of said instrument.

I have three checkboxes for three effects, this adds the effect to said instrument.

I have JSON involved to move data to the preprocesslogic from the data in accordion items.

I have a d3 that shows bar graph for volume & reverb for each instrument in the accordion.

I recorded my video:
